A tool for domain experts to find recent and relevant public discourse on topics they are familiar with

## Motivation

The increasing accessibility of scientific articles and surrounding public discourse is generally beneficial to society. A tradeoff to this increased public consumption of knowledge in formats traditionally meant for domain experts is the rise of misinformation. Articles in scientific journals often describe specific facts and precise outcomes under specific conditions, and their validity and generalizability are usually only understood by a few experts. On the other hand, social media such as Reddit and Twitter allow anyone (often anonymously) to post articles and comment about their contents, and it is in these forums that wrong information is conveyed. The wide audience of these forums, coupled with increased public interest on scientific topics involving the brain (for example, in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic), has made it imperative that experts be able to find and engage such posts. This project, pitched for Brainhack Toronto 2021, seeks to create a live feed of active and relevant public discussions on widely used social media forums.
